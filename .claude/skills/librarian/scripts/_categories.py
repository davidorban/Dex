_categories.py — Canonical Subject / Geography taxonomy for the Research library.

This module is the **single source of truth** (in code) for which top-level folders
under 06-Resources/Research/ are considered valid "Subject" categories.

It enforces the contract defined in:
  "Research Document Repository - User Guide.docx"
  (the authoritative human document living alongside the PDFs)

Phase 1 design decisions (documented for Claude review):
- We validate primarily on the first path component (Subject).
- Geography / Scope (second path component) is captured for frontmatter but is
  intentionally *permissive* in v1. The User Guide defines a tree, not a rigid
  closed set of geography values per subject. Strict geography whitelisting would
  cause constant maintenance pain every time a new "Regional (X)" or "Policy"
  subfolder appears.
- Unknown subjects cause a hard failure with a clear, actionable error message
  that tells the user exactly which file to consult and how to extend the list.
- The list below was mechanically extracted from the on-disk folder tree on
  2026-05-16 and cross-checked against the visible structure in the User Guide.
- Future improvement (Phase 3+): add a `librarian refresh-taxonomy` command that
  uses the anthropic-docx skill to re-parse the .docx narrative + folder map and
  proposes an updated _categories.py (or a JSON sidecar).

This file is deliberately **not** a data file that the ingest script "reads at
runtime from the docx". That would have required either (a) python-docx + complex
narrative parsing or (b) a one-time manual extraction that then drifts. The
current approach gives us the desired "fail loud on unknown category" behaviour
while keeping the implementation in one small, reviewable file.

Usage:
    from _categories import derive_subject_geography, validate_subject

    subject, geo = derive_subject_geography(Path("Cryptocurrency/Stablecoin/foo.pdf"))
    ok, err = validate_subject(subject)
    if not ok:
        raise ValueError(err)
